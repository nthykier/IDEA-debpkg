  - canonicalName: Test-Command
    description: |
      <p>If your test only contains a shell command or two, or you want to

         field to specify the shell command directly. It will be run under
         <b>bash -e</b>. This is mutually exclusive with the <b>Tests:</b> field.</p>

      <p>This is also useful for running the same script under different

    valueType: FREE_TEXT_VALUE

  - canonicalName: Restrictions
    description: |
      <p>Declares some restrictions or problems with the tests defined in
         this stanza. Depending on the test environment capabilities, user
         requests, and so on, restrictions can cause tests to be skipped or
         can cause the test to be run in a different manner. Tests which
         declare unknown restrictions will be skipped.</p>

         <p>Restrictions are separated by commas and/or whitespace.</p>
    valueType: SPACE_SEPARATED_VALUE_LIST
    keywordList:
      - value: "rw-build-tree"
        description: |
          <p>The test(s) needs write access to the built source tree (so it may
             need to be copied first). Even with this restriction, the test is
             not allowed to make any change to the built source tree which (i)
             isn't cleaned up by debian/rules clean, (ii) affects the future
             results of any test, or (iii) affects binary packages produced by
             the build tree in the future.</p>
      - value: "breaks-testbed"
        description: |
          <p>The test, when run, is liable to break the testbed system. This
             includes causing data loss, causing services that the machine is
             running to malfunction, or permanently disabling services; it does
             not include causing services on the machine to temporarily fail.</p>

             <p>When this restriction is present the test will usually be skipped
             unless the testbed's virtualisation arrangements are sufficiently
             powerful, or alternatively if the user explicitly requests.</p>
      - value: "needs-sudo"
        description: |
          <p>The test script needs to be run as a non-root user who is a member of
          the <b>sudo</b> group, and has the ability to elevate privileges to root
          on-demand.</p>

          <p>This is useful for testing user components which should not normally
          be run as root, in test scenarios that require configuring a system
          service to support the test. For example, gvfs has a test-case which
          uses sudo for privileged configuration of a Samba server, so that
          the unprivileged gvfs service under test can communicate with that server.</p>

          <p>While running a test with this restriction, <b>sudo(8)</b> will be
          installed and configured to allow members of the <b>sudo</b> group to run
          any command without password authentication.</p>

          <p>Because the test user is a member of the <b>sudo</b> group, they will
          also gain the ability to take any other privileged actions that are
          controlled by membership in that group. In particular, several packages
          install <b>polkit(8)</b> policies allowing members of group <b>sudo</b> to
          take administrative actions with or without authentication.</p>

          <p>If the test requires access to additional privileged actions, it may
          use its access to <b>sudo(8)</b> to install additional configuration
          files, for example configuring <b>polkit(8)</b> or <b>doas.conf(5)</b>
          to allow running <b>pkexec(1)</b> or <b>doas(1)</b> without authentication.</p>

          <p>Commands run via <b>sudo(8)</b> or another privilege-elevation tool could
          be run with either "global root" or root in a container, depending
          on the presence or absence of the <b>isolation-machine</b> restriction,
          in the same way described for <b>needs-root</b>.</p>
      - value: "needs-root"
        description: |
          <p>The test script must be run as root.</p>

                 <p>While running tests with this restriction, some test runners will
                 set the <b>AUTOPKGTEST_NORMAL_USER</b> environment variable to the name
                 of an ordinary user account. If so, the test script may drop
                 privileges from root to that user, for example via the <b>runuser</b>
                 command. Test scripts must not assume that this environment variable
                 will always be set.</p>

                 <p>For tests that declare both the <b>needs-root</b> and <b>isolation-machine</b>
                 restrictions, the test may assume that it has "global root" with full
                 control over the kernel that is running the test, and not just root
                 in a container (more formally, it has uid 0 and full capabilities in
                 the initial user namespace as defined in <b>user_namespaces(7)</b>).
                 For example, it can expect that mounting block devices will succeed.</p>

                 <p>For tests that declare the <b>needs-root</b> restriction but not the
                 <b>isolation-machine</b> restriction, the test will be run as uid 0 in
                 a user namespace with a reasonable range of system and user uids
                 available, but will not necessarily have full control over the kernel,
                 and in particular it is not guaranteed to have elevated capabilities
                 in the initial user namespace as defined by <b>user_namespaces(7)</b>.
                 For example, it might be run in a namespace where uid 0 is mapped to
                 an ordinary uid in the initial user namespace, or it might run in a
                 Docker-style container where global uid 0 is used but its ability to
                 carry out operations that affect the whole system is restricted by
                 capabilities and system call filtering.  Tests requiring particular
                 privileges should use the <b>skippable</b> restriction to check for
                 required functionality at runtime.</p>
      - value: "build-needed"
        description: |
          <p>The tests need to be run from a built source tree. The test runner
             will build the source tree (honouring the source package's build
             dependencies), before running the tests. However, the tests are
             <em>not</em> entitled to assume that the source package's build
             dependencies will be installed when the test is run.</p>

             <p>Please use this considerately, as for large builds it unnecessarily
             builds the entire project when you only need a tiny subset (like the
             tests/ subdirectory). It is often possible to run <b>make -C tests</b>
             instead, or copy the test code to <b>$AUTOPKGTEST_TMP</b> and build it
             there with some custom commands. This cuts down the load on the
             Continuous Integration servers and also makes tests more robust as
             it prevents accidentally running them against the built source tree
             instead of the installed packages.
             </p>
      - value: "allow-stderr"
        description: |
          <p>Output to stderr is not considered a failure. This is useful for
             tests which write e. g. lots of logging to stderr.</p>
      - value: "isolation-container"
        description: |
          <p>The test wants to start services or open network TCP ports. This
                 commonly fails in a simple chroot/schroot, so tests need to be run
                 in their own container (e. g. autopkgtest-virt-lxc) or their own
                 machine/VM (e. g. autopkgtest-virt-qemu or autopkgtest-virt-null).
                 When running the test in a virtualization server which does not
                 provide this (like autopkgtest-schroot) it will be skipped.</p>

                 <p>Tests may assume that this restriction implies that process 1 in the
                 container's process namespace is a system service manager (init system)
                 such as systemd or sysvinit + sysv-rc, and therefore system services
                 are available via the <b>service(8)</b>, <b>invoke-rc.d(8)</b> and
                 <b>update-rc.d(8))</b> interfaces.</p>

                 <p>Tests must not assume that a specific init system is in use: a
                 dependency such as <b>systemd-sysv</b> or <b>sysvinit-core</b> does not work
                 in practice, because switching the init system often cannot be done
                 automatically. Tests that require a specific init system should use the
                 <b>skippable</b> restriction, and skip the test if the required init system
                 was not detected.</p>

                 <p>Many implementations of the <b>isolation-container</b> restriction will
                 also provide <b>systemd-logind(8)</b> or a compatible interface, but this
                 is not guaranteed. Tests requiring a login session registered with
                 logind should declare a dependency on <b>default-logind | logind</b>
                 or on a more specific implementation of <b>logind</b>, and should use the
                 <b>skippable</b> restriction to exit gracefully if its functionality is
                 not available at runtime.</p>
      - value: "isolation-machine"
        description: |
          <p>The test wants to interact with the kernel, reboot the machine, or
             other things which fail in a simple schroot and even a container.
             Those tests need to be run in their own machine/VM (e. g.
             autopkgtest-virt-qemu or autopkgtest-virt-null). When running the
             test in a virtualization server which does not provide this it will
             be skipped.</p>

             <p>This restriction also provides the same facilities as
             <b>isolation-container</b>.</p>
      - value: "needs-reboot"
        description: |
          <p>The test wants to reboot the machine using <b>/tmp/autopkgtest-reboot</b>.</p>
      - value: "needs-internet"
        description: |
          <p>The test needs unrestricted internet access, e.g. to download test data
             that's not shipped as a package, or to test a protocol implementation
             against a test server. Please also see the note about Network access later
             in this document.</p>
      - value: "needs-recommends"
        description: |
          <p><em>Deprecated:</em> Please use <b>@recommends@</b> in your test <b>Depends:</b> instead.</p>
      - value: "flaky"
        description: |
          <p>The test is expected to fail intermittently, and is not suitable for
             gating continuous integration. This indicates a bug in either the
             package under test, a dependency or the test itself, but such bugs
             can be difficult to fix, and it is often difficult to know when the
             bug has been fixed without running the test for a while. If a
             <b>flaky</b> test succeeds, it will be treated like any other
             successful test, but if it fails it will be treated as though it
             had been skipped.</p>
      - value: "skippable"
        description: |
          <p>The test might need to be skipped for reasons that cannot be
             described by an existing restriction such as isolation-machine or
             breaks-testbed, but must instead be detected at runtime. If the
             test exits with status 77 (a convention borrowed from Automake), it
             will be treated as though it had been skipped. If it exits with any
             other status, its success or failure will be derived from the exit
             status and stderr as usual. Test authors must be careful to ensure
             that <b>skippable</b> tests never exit with status 77 for reasons that
             should be treated as a failure.</p>
      - value: "skip-not-installable"
        description: |
          <p>This restrictions may cause a test to miss a regression due to
             installability issues, so use with caution. If one only wants to
             skip certain architectures, use the <b>Architecture</b> field for
             that.</p>

             <p>This test might have test dependencies that can't be fulfilled in
             all suites or in derivatives. Therefore, when apt-get installs the
             test dependencies, it will fail. Don't treat this as a test
             failure, but instead treat it as if the test was skipped.</p>
      - value: "hint-testsuite-triggers"
        description: |
          <p>This test exists purely as a hint to suggest when rerunning the
             tests is likely to be useful.  Specifically, it exists to
             influence the way dpkg-source generates the Testsuite-Triggers
             .dsc header from test metadata: the Depends for this test are
             to be added to Testsuite-Triggers.  (Just as they are for any other
             test.)</p>

             <p>The test with the hint-testsuite-triggers restriction should not
             actually be run.</p>

             <p>The packages listed as Depends for this test are usually indirect
             dependencies, updates to which are considered to pose a risk of
             regressions in other tests defined in this package.</p>

             <p>There is currently no way to specify this hint on a per-test
             basis; but in any case the debian.org machinery is not able to
             think about triggering individual tests.</p>
      - value: "superficial"
        description: |
          <p>The test does not provide significant test coverage, so if it
             passes, that does not necessarily mean that the package under test
             is actually functional. If a <b>superficial</b> test fails, it will be
             treated like any other failing test, but if it succeeds, this is
             only a weak indication of success. Continuous integration systems
             should treat a package where all non-superficial tests are skipped as
             equivalent to a package where all tests are skipped.</p>
          
             <p>For example, a C library might have a superficial test that simply
             compiles, links and executes a "hello world" program against the
             library under test but does not attempt to make use of the library's
             functionality, while a Python or Perl library might have a
             superficial test that runs <b>import foo</b> or <b>require Foo;</b> but
             does not attempt to use the library beyond that.</p>

  - canonicalName: Depends
    description: |
      <p>Declares that the specified packages must be installed for the test

         the architecture qualifiers (see
         https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html),
         plus the following extensions:</p>

         <p><b>@</b> stands for the package(s) generated by the source package
         containing the tests; each dependency (strictly, or-clause, which
         may contain <b>|</b>'s but not commas) containing <b>@</b> is replicated
         once for each such binary package, with the binary package name
         substituted for each <b>@</b> (but normally <b>@</b> should occur only
         once and without a version restriction).</p>

         <p><b>@builddeps@</b> will be replaced by the package's
         <b>Build-Depends:</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Indep:</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Arch:</b>, and
         <b>build-essential</b>. This is useful if you have many build
         dependencies which are only necessary for running the test suite and
         you don't want to replicate them in the test <b>Depends:</b>. However,
         please use this sparingly, as this can easily lead to missing binary
         package dependencies being overlooked if they get pulled in via
         build dependencies.</p>

         <p><b>@recommends@</b> stands for all the packages listed in the
         <b>Recommends:</b> fields of all the binary packages mentioned in the
         <b>debian/control</b> file. Please note that variables are stripped,
         so if some required test dependencies aren't explicitly mentioned,
         they may not be installed.</p>

         <p>If no Depends field is present, <b>Depends: @</b> is assumed. Note that
         the source tree's Build-Dependencies are *not* necessarily
         installed, and if you specify any Depends, no binary packages from
         the source are installed unless explicitly requested.</p>
